# Important!

I always was fascinated about OSS and always felt the need to contribute to OSS. I'v OSSed this repository! Feel free to clone the repository and build your own personal space similar to mine or tinker with the code to build your own version of your digital space that you always wished you could have!

## Installation

To test the project out locally, flollow the below mentioned steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the cloned directory
   
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Prajwal-S-Venkatesh/prajwalsv.dev.git
$ cd prajwalsv.dev
```

2. Install all the dependencies
```sh
$ npm install
```

3. Run the server and view the app on http://localhost:3001

## Hosting

If you want to host your version of MDS, you can do so using firebase hosting. Don't worry it's FREE! Just follow the steps mentioned [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0). Once done you'll get a Firebase configuration object that you can use in this app and deploy it onto firebase static hosting.
